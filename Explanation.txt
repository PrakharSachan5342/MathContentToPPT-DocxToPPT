Explanation of code:-

1 - he code installs the required packages, python-docx and python-pptx, using !pip install commands.

2 - It imports the necessary modules: docx for working with Word documents, Presentation from pptx for creating PowerPoint presentations, 
and files from google.colab for downloading the output file.

3 - It creates a new PowerPoint presentation using Presentation()

4 - The code iterates through the paragraphs in the Word document

5 - For each paragraph, it checks if the text contains keywords such as
 "equation," "graph," or "diagram" using a case-insensitive comparison

6 - If the paragraph contains mathematical content, it extracts the content and performs specific actions based on the type of content

7 - If the content is an equation, it processes the equation, calculates the result,
 and adds the equation and result to a new slide in the PowerPoint presentation

8 - If the content is a graph or diagram, it extracts the graph data, generates a graph image,
 and adds the image to a new slide in the PowerPoint presentation

9 - The code saves the PowerPoint presentation as "output.pptx".

10 - Finally, it downloads the output file using files.download()

*IMP - Note: Some specific functions such as process_equation(), calculate_result(), extract_graph_data(), and generate_graph_image() are assumed to be implemented separately based on their respective purposes
